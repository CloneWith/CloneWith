- Love computing. Currently learning C# , Python and algorism.
- Interested in Go and some trending languages.
- Interested in translating of wikis, documents, etc. (I'll thank you if you can help me review my recent translations!❤️)

So this is all I can say about myself, at least now. 
Maybe this profile update from time to time. Don't forget to have a look!
